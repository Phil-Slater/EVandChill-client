                We are three developers with a passion for technology and
                planning sub-details for trips. This project is birthed from the
                knowledge that charging electric vehicles take time to charge
                before making the next leg on a trip. Together, we have crafted
                this application to not only assist users in locating EV
                charging stations at various destinations (as well as nearby),
                but to also locate food and other pasttimes while waiting, all
                in one place!

                The site that you see is built with React and Redux. Axios is
                used to store default URL and header information to communicate
                with our backend. The animations on this site are done entirely
                through CSS transitions triggered by JavaScript events.
